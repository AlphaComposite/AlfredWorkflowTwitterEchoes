# Alfred Workflow for Twitter Levantines
This Alfred workflow allows you to select a Twitter username in the browser and perform an advanced search on Twitter for that username.

1. Select the text of the username you wish to search for in your browser.
2. Launch the workflow by using the hotkey combination for the workflow. Default hotkey combination on the Mac is Control + Shift + T.
3. The browser navigates to Twitter's advanced search page with the username and several search keywords that were populated by the workflow's Open URL workflow component(you can change these parameters, but don't come crying to me if you break it).
